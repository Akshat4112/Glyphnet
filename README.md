# GlyphNet: Homoglyph domains dataset and detection using attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks
GlyphNet is a project aimed at detecting homoglyph attacks using an attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It leverages a unique approach involving image datasets of domain names, real and homoglyphs, to train the model.
